# Triangles

A simulation of the game Triangles.

## What is Triangles?

Triangles is a game where each person randomly
chooses 2 people and then they try to form an equilateral
triangle with them.
In small numbers it's trivial but in larger numbers, it's more complex.
Especially as you don't know who each player chose. 

## This Repo

This is a basic simulation of it where each point finds their ideal spot
to be at and then goes towards it.

By editting vars, randomness can be added,
boundaries, the points can have a trail,
it can aim for the other triangle,
the points can try to avoid other points

triangles.py is the main file

This code is messy, I created it out of curiosity and didn't really focus on
readability/re-usability or any coding standards
